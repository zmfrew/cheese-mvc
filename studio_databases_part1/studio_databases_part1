CREATE TABLE directors(
    director_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    country VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE movies (
    movie_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    title VARCHAR(120),
    year INTEGER,
    director_id INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (director_id) REFERENCES directors(director_id)
);

    1.List all the titles of the movies in the database.

    SELECT titles FROM movies;

    2. List all the titles of the movies in the database in descending order 
    of the year they were released.

    SELECT titles FROM movies 
        ORDER BY year DESC;

    3. Insert a new record into the directors table for Jean-Pierre Jeunet 
    whose country of origin is France. (Note: Assume the column for director_id 
    is auto incremented, so you don't need to put in a value for that column.)

    INSERT INTO directors VALUES("Jean-Pierre", "Jeanut", "France");

    4. List the director_id for Jean-Pierre Jeunet.

    SELECT TOP(1) director_id FROM directors;
    or
    SELECT director_id FROM directors
        WHERE first_name = "Jean-Pierre" AND last_name = "Jeanuet";

    5. Insert a new record into the movies table for Amelie which was released 
    in 2001 and directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. (Hint: Assume the id you got 
    from the last query was "2" and use that. And, like question 3, assume 
    the movie_id column is auto incremented).

    INSERT INTO movies VALUES("New Movie", 2001, 2);

    6. List all columns for all records of the directors table in ascending 
    alphabetical order of the director's country of origin.

    SELECT * FROM directors
        ORDER BY country asc;

    7. List the country of origin of the director of Amelie. (You could do this 
    using either a join or a subquery. Use a join.)

    SELECT directors.country, directors.first_name, directors.last_name, movies.title 
        FROM movies
        INNER JOIN directors
        ON movies.director_id=directors.director_id;
    
    8.List all the movies in the database along with each movie's director, 
    ordered by the director's last name in ascending order. (Hint: you'll want 
    to use a join and choose the columns title, first, and last).

    SELECT movies.title, directors.first_name, directors.last_name 
        FROM movies
        INNER JOIN directors
        ON movies.director_id=directors.director_id
        ORDER BY directors.last_name asc;
